        <h2>
            <b>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</b>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I would say that it was a bit difficult to publish my website and understand where to go for this. I have not
            had to commit multiple files, at least like this, before. So, this was a brand new experience for me. I talked
            to some people I knew in this class before I went to ED discussion and I was able to find out what I needed to do.

            <b>
                What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
            </b>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I have learned how there are multiple commands we can use for coding HTML. Additionally, we can try not to use div
            to create semantic reading that computers and other devices can use to read a program more easily. This helps people
            looking at your code understand what they're reading with the lack of comments.

        <h2>
            <b>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing
            this assignment? How did you use these resources?</b>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I used YouTube for this assignment to overlook some HTML tips I could use. However, the main bulk of this assignment
            was from the lecture videos that are recorded in class, which allowed me to remember what I had learned in high
            school, and apply that knowledge here.

        <h2>
            <b>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those
                problems?</b>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I feel that this assignment was especially challenging because of all the syntax. I had a difficult time finding everything
            I was supposed to use for this assignment and it was confusing to get what I was supposed to be using for this code. To solve
            these issues, I went online and looked back at the class videos. I was not able to find everything that I needed, but I was
            able to do most of it.

        <h2>
            <b>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</b>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I learnt how to use CSS to manipulate your page, and I now understand how to address pointers, headers, and classes. I was
            surprised to see how broad CSS could apply, like applying to every h2 header in your program vs going to one specific class.
            I didn't know much beforehand, which possibly made this program difficult, but I was able to learn a few things on how to 
            use CSS to edit an HTML page.

        <h2>
            <b>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites?
                Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</b>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            I wasn't able to find any specific websites or resources as many of them were based around HTML. I was able to look at last
            week's lecture videos in order to understand a few things about CSS, and a few other YouTube videos. I looked at the concepts
            that were explained and understood what I was supposed to do. I saw why you would use one thing over another.

            <b>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</b>

            How to wrap two different headers and how to change the hovering text color.
