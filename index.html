                        I created a website in the past in my web design class.

                    <li>
                        I was able to make transitions as well, but it has been a while since I've done HTML and I'm rusty on it.

                    <li>
                        I hope to learn how to make sites that attract people and could pick up in the job market.
                        Additionally, I hope to learn how to use Web Dev to my advantage and dive into it as another skill.

                        I have <u>not</u> joined the Campuswide forum yet.

                The most interesting fact about me is that I've been doing martial arts for over a decade,
                with a second degree black belt in Taekwondo and MMA, a brown belt in Tang Soo Do,
                and knowledge in Jiu Jitsu and kickboxing.
